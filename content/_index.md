## THREAT DEFUSER

#### September 2020 - August 2026

- [Project overview](overview.pdf)
- [Proposal](proposal.pdf)

THREAT-DEFUSER explores the role of "soft" information strategies propagated
through mass and social media that constitute hybrid warfare. We investigate
Norwegian perceptions of Russia, as well as Russian perceptions of Norway, in
the context of Norwegian national security.

THREAT-DEFUSER is a
multi-disciplinary project that combines state-of-the-art methodologies from
political science, linguistics and media studies to forge new methodologies.
Whereas academic disciplines tend to be disproportionately focused on the
English-speaking world, THREAT-DEFUSER breaks away from that narrow view,
focusing instead on Russian and two official languages of Norway: Norwegian and
North Saami. Three cultural perspectives are opened up: 1) a major
international language, since Russian is the second most-used language on the
Internet; 2) a majority national language; 3) a minority indigenous language.

The tools created by THREAT-DEFUSER are portable to other languages, cultures,
and domains, and will be shared open source with the international research
community. THREAT-DEFUSER actively disseminates research findings to political
authorities (via evidence briefs and closed workshops), to academics (via
high-quality open access scholarly journals), and to the public at large
through a dedicated, regularly updated website, podcasts, school visits and an
app that facilitates rapid response to the dynamic landscape of news and social
media.

THREAT-DEFUSER assesses Russia's increasingly assertive role in matters
of foreign and security policy, particularly in relation to their engagement in
hybrid warfare. The same tools are implemented also to analyze Russian
attitudes to Europe that have a direct bearing on Norwegian-Russian relations.

THREAT-DEFUSER is funded by the
[Research Council of Norway](https://www.forskningsradet.no/), grant number 300002.
